# My personal website!

1-day personal website built with React to procrastinate :) *If you're my manager and watching me update my personal website instead of responding to pr #932 on linear please let me cook <3*

Inspired by [quinn ha](https://www.quinnha.xyz/), [chengsu chen](https://www.chengsuchen.com/), [catherine yeo](https://catherinehyeo.com/), and everyone's websites that I stalked :)

## To-do:

- [x] Deploy website
- [x] Change to better CSS Framework (MUI or Tailwind)
- [x] Mobile-friendly
- [ ] Day/Night Mode
- [ ] Guestbook
- [ ] [chatbot_me](https://github.com/Tapiocaba/chatbot_me): mini-message app style!
